# Financial Tools by Stefanos Stavrianos

This repository contains a curated collection of Python-based utilities developed for financial econometrics, risk modeling, and market data analysis. Each script has been designed with academic transparency and reproducibility in mind, following the standards expected in quantitative finance research. The tools address common needs in empirical finance such as market data extraction, volatility analysis, and portfolio construction.

All scripts are free to use for non-commercial purposes. For detailed tutorials and usage examples, visit the official blog: [www.stavrianoseconblog.eu](https://www.stavrianoseconblog.eu) and my personal website [wwwstefanstavrianos.eu](https://www.stefanstavrianos.eu)
